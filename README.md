*p.s i'm at my limit.i dont think i can do this anymore. am i cool?im definitely a cool girl. at least thats what they say i am. but what is a cool girl? is it the girls who chug down coke and beer and eat pizzas and brgers all the while keeping a waistline of 26? s it the girls who listens to obsucure punk ands and is always getting herself backstage for local band's gigs? How about the girls who mismatch their socks and wear frilly dresses and have unique smiles and goofy smirks, the ones who listens to bands that arent mainstream or the ones who hate taylor swift? Cool girl isn't real.I am not real.I am made to be a concept of being cool and different for the purpose of being accepted in a world were being a girl alone without any sort of uniqueness in their personality is seen as abd. I just want to be me. I don't even know who I am anymore. live laugh love:heart:*
